## Project Inspiration
This bot was inspired by an activity in Red Dead Redemption Online (RDO), which allows you to preform wagon steals on players running deliveries. The objective of this content is to steal the player's wagon, and successfully make it to an alternative seller location. Upon successful delivery, the guild member will say type a target phrase in a designated channel to record their wagon steal.

Therefore, the bot aims to give the ability to any member to look back in the message history and see how many occurrences of a target word/phrase of have been said by each user, and then return this information in a formated chart.
